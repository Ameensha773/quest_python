GitHub:
 
1. Create git hub account. Verify with the OTP sent to your email.
2. Generate PAT.
	my_icon -> seetings -> developer settings -> create personal access token -> classic -> select Repo and 2 other options
3. Copy and save the PAT in a file and save the file in C:\software folder.
4. Now download and install git.
5. Now, go into your working folder and open the command prompt.
6. Go to your repository that you just created, and copy the URL.
Example: https://www.gihub.com/nithin/quest_python
6. Run the command:
	$> git close https://www.PAT@gihub.com/nithin_n/quest_python
	PAT here is the personal access token
7. Now run the commands:
	git config --global user.name "nithin_n"
	git config --global user.email "mtd.nithin@gmail.com"
8. Now, open the VS code from the working folder.
	You can see a folder with your repo name
9. When ever we do any changes to the repo (adding or deleteing or modyfying files and folder),
 we must click on the version_control icon in VS code (Left most corner 3rd vertical icon). 
 Now, in the message box, add the relevant message (day2 notes and programs are added) and click on COMMIT button. 
 Next, click on the SYNC button and then click OK when you are prompted.
